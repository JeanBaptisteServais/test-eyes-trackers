# _apply_from_Tuto-eyes-trackers
based on a pupil tracker, conda, dlib, cv2, model pre formed and tuto we try to detect the eye

<strong> 2 applications: First's </strong> pupil tracker (live), <strong>Second part</strong> of our eyes tracker (video register, cause distant serveur)

<strong>For example: </strong> put some animation on the face, alarm in case the conductor sleeps, eyes movement and duration on a web site, an experience of visual attention (you can consult it on the great web site: synergo).
